I decided this week to add the ability for the player to sleep and recover health. When the player sleeps, FOV is restricted down to a single square radius but for NPCs, the full range still counts so the player can be targeted by NPCs they can't immediately see. As a nice side effect, this means I can now have a separate FOV applying to NPCs over the player and I may then implement some sort of stealth system (reader, he will probably not). I may tweak it so that you need some sort of consumable to sleep but it's fine without for the moment.

Because I fixed up the action points and game loop, I was able to easily add in a speed spell which can adjust an entity's speed both up and down. It was a good time to refactor how I do potions so it's much more generic. Now I create a single method for the new effect and that can be leveraged to create either a potion, scroll or equipment ability.
