Nothing major this week, but I did get around to two things in my backlog:
1) Finally changed the from the default font file from the limited set in the tutorial and instead I'm now using one from the [Dwarf Fortress titleset repo](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/Tileset_repository). It took a bit of experimentation of find a set that looked good to my eyes, but a small amount of time really for a good result.

2) Messages are now filtered by what occurs in the player's FOV so there's less spam in the messages from off screen events. A relatively small change that makes things a little less chaotic in the message log, but meant some tedious refactoring. Still, worth it.
