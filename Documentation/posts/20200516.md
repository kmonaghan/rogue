This release was mostly around invisible-to-the-user changes, a few bug fixes and a minor creature addition.

The biggest change in this version is that I now load base weapon and armour descriptions from JSON files. I've been humming and hawing about this for a while and decided to finally bite the bullet. The reason for my reluctance was that I wanted particular NPCs to have set equipment and over thought the fact that I'm referencing items that are no longer directly in the code. This will probably expand to include entity types, but then I'll need to figure out the best way to have equipment sets and ability options. As it is, I do need to figure out how I should be adding level probabilities to the equipment so it just doesn't all appear at

I'd badly broken targeting for scrolls in a previous version when I added in the capability for the player to sleep, so that's fixed again. I then discovered I'd broken the spells themselves. And since I was fixing them, I obviously had to tweak and change something, so the lightning spell is now a chain lightning spell that bounces between a number of targets. But why just limit the spells to scrolls? The `Ability` component now has a subclass `SpellAbility` which triggers a spell effect on a successful hit. I also decided to change my naming convention for dice parameters just because. You couldn't possibly accuse me of ever yak shaving.

The only visible change to the player (bar a slightly expanded set of possible equipment) is the addition of a bat roost that spawns bats until destroyed.

I haven't posted any gifs of gameplay, so have 2! [A disastrous first run getting killed by a rat swarm](https://imgur.com/hrDzdgD) and [rats eating eggs and snakes eating rats](https://imgur.com/SJ1aPMw).
