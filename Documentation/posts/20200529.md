**Yet Another Unnamed Diablo Inspired Roguelike**

Updates since the last version have been very scattershot. My intention had been to solely work on refactoring the item generation to be more _Diablo_ like but I've ended up yak shaving and bouncing around poking at various other features and squashing a few minor bugs.

Item generation is still very much a work in progress with a lot of work to do and the feeling there is not a lot of headway made. Equipment now can trigger effects on equip/dequip. Some separation around naming has been setup with an attempt to generate unique items split out. Plenty more work is needed and it's something to pick away at over the next few weeks.  

I did make a start on creating quest chains based on the mini-boss on each level after the first. It's a three step chain involving clearing out particular entities, then eliminating the mini-boss and exiting the level. Not particularly inspiring right now but at least it's a base to build from.

Once of the nicer little coding distractions was adding a component to provide some basic animations for entities. I can now pass in array of characters and they are rotated through in order. My test creature was a swarm of [hornets](https://imgur.com/a/iyrCBGp) using three characters to simulate lots of insects buzzing about. Bats now hunt hornets. Unless they're vampire bats. Then they hunt _you_.

I've also added a hook in GitHub to connect into [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/) based on [this tutorial](https://gameswithgrids.com/blog/automated-code-quality/). My aim here is to see where I can improve my still novice level Python.
