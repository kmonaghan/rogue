**Yet Another Unnamed Diablo Inspired Roguelike**

Python | libtcod | [GitHub](https://github.com/kmonaghan/rogue) | Release [0.0.7](https://github.com/kmonaghan/rogue/tree/release/0.0.7) | [Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/gt48z7/sharing_saturday_313/fsaownd/?context=3)

Given it's been a couple of months since I last pushed an update it seemed like I'd not accomplished much, but then going back over the commits it was a lot of small things spread out that combine into a much larger whole.

After adding the hook in GitHub to connect into [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/), it lead to my first bout of yak shaving refactoring. It was mostly removing code smells but it did fix a couple of bugs and I removed a good chunk of dead code (the *best* sort of refactoring).

I've been following the [V2 refactor of the tutorial](https://github.com/TStand90/tcod_tutorial_v2) with great interest. There's plenty in there I am going to back port into my version - especially around the game loop, input handling and rendering to screen. Some of this has already started, especially around how I render the map. I've now a lot more control over what gets rendered when by breaking up the original method into multiple smaller, more targeted methods. Long term I'll be moving from the depreciated methods and going all in on contexts.

As I was doing the refactor, I had a happy accident with the torch effect which I think is a [little more atmospheric](https://imgur.com/jKuDo2H) \- the tile features outside of the FOV remain but on a black background. I'm rather pleased with how it looks anyway.

I've been having some annoying-to-debug issues with my entities and their behaviours, so I spent a bit of time in getting a couple of debug helpers. Now in debug mode, if I mouse over an entity, I can see the last path they tried to take, a Dijkstra representation of what's walkable and what they're targeting. In the console it prints out some details on the entity, so I can effectively see what's it is thinking.

You can see an example of what it [looks like in-game](https://imgur.com/p5H2Vhs), and below is the output for one of the rats highlighted in the above :

    Rat 15, 16 980c9c91-19b5-4e23-83f2-73e27778ec89 (Level 1) O:2 D:1
    1 (0/100)
    targeting: Snake 15, 17 b9d65d9f-5cfd-40ac-a202-b3db7cca7919 (Level 1) O:2 D:1
    Last behaviours: ['InNamespace', 'target', 'IsAdjacent', 'Attack']

This is telling me:

Line 1: entity name, it's at the point 15, 16, its UUID, level, offence and defence values

Line 2: level and current xp

Line 3: the entity has a target and the details of the target

Line 4: What behaviour nodes it used in last determining its next action.

So in summary, lots of internal changes that are (mostly) invisible to the user, but should improve the stability of the game.
